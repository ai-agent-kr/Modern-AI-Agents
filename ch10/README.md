# AI Travel Planner with Streamlit

This project is a Streamlit-based web application that uses multiple AI agents to recommend:

- The best months to visit a location (weather-based).
- Personalized hotel recommendations (via sentence embeddings).
- A complete day-by-day travel itinerary (via OpenAI GPT-4).

## ⚠️ Known Warnings & Fixes

### Tokenizers Parallelism Warning

Add this line at the top of your script to prevent HuggingFace fork-related deadlocks:

```python
import os
os.environ["TOKENIZERS_PARALLELISM"] = "false"
```

### Torch Custom Class RuntimeError

You might see:

```
RuntimeError: Tried to instantiate class '__path__._path'...
```

This is a harmless warning caused by Streamlit's file watcher trying to inspect PyTorch internals. It can be ignored.
