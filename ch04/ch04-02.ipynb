[1] Jun 4, 2025 · 지금까지 1948년부터 2030년까지 역대 대한민국 대통령과 그 시대의 변화, 그리고 2025 년 이재명 대통령 당선 및 개헌 논의까지 총정리해봤습니다. Jun 3, 2025 · 제21대 대통령 선거 개표 결과 이재명 더불어민주당 후보가 대통령에 당선됐다. Jun 16, 2025 · 대선 결과: 누가 누구에게 투표했는가? 2025 년 대통령 선거에서 진보 성향의 더불어민주당 소속 이재명 후보가 총 득표율 49.42%로 승리했습니다. 주요 경쟁자인 보수 정당 국민의힘 소속 김문수 후보는 41.15%를 기록했습니다. 이번 선거에 선출되는 대통령은 원칙적으로 5년의 임기 동안 업무를 수행한다. 대통령 궐위로 인한 선거는 공직선거법상 '보궐선거'라고 규정하지는 않으나 다른 공직선거의 보궐선거에 적용되는 규정이 거의 대부분 적용된다.\""

            "Summary: Abraham Lincoln (February 12, 1809 – April 15, 1865) was the 16th president of the United States, serving from 1861 until his assassination in 1865. He led the United States through the American Civil War, defeating the Confederate States and playing a major role in the abolition of slavery.\n",
            "Lincoln was born into poverty in Kentucky and raised on the frontier. He was self-educated and became a lawyer, Illinois state legislator, and U.S. representative. Angered by the Kansas–Nebraska Act of 1854, which opened the territories to slavery, he became a leader of the new Republican Party. He reached a national audience in the 1858 Senate campaign debates against Stephen A. Douglas. Lincoln won the 1860 presidential election, prompting a majority of slave states to begin to secede and form the Confederate States. A month after Lincoln assumed the presidency, Confederate forces attacked Fort Sumter, starting the Civil War.\n",
            "As a moderate Republican, Lincoln had to navigate conflicting political opinions from contentious factions during the war effort. Lincoln closely supervised the strategy and tactics in the war effort, including the selection of generals, and implemented a naval blockade of Southern ports. He suspended the writ of habeas corpus in April 1861, an action that Chief Justice Roger Taney found unconstitutional in Ex parte Merryman, and he averted war with Britain by defusing the Trent Affair. On January 1, 1863, he issued the Emancipation Proclamation, which declared the slaves in the states \"in rebellion\" to be free. On November 19, 1863, he delivered the Gettysburg Address, which became one of the most famous speeches in American history. He promoted the Thirteenth Amendment to the U.S. Constitution, which, in 1865, abolished chattel slavery. Re-elected in 1864, he sought to heal the war-torn nation through Reconstruction.\n",
            "\n",
            "On April 14, 1865, five days after the Confederate surrender at Appomattox, Lincoln was attending a play at Ford's Theatre in Washington, D.C., when he was fatally shot by Confederate sympathizer John Wilkes Booth. Lincoln is remembered as a martyr and a national hero for his wartime leadership and for his efforts to preserve the Union and abolish slavery. He is often ranked in both popular and scholarly polls as the greatest president in American history.\n",

            "Summary: On April 14, 1865, Abraham Lincoln, the 16th president of the United States, was shot by John Wilkes Booth while attending the play Our American Cousin at Ford's Theatre in Washington, D.C. Shot in the head as he watched the play, Lincoln died of his wounds the following day at 7:22 a.m. in the Petersen House across the street from the theater. He was the first U.S. president to be assassinated. His funeral and burial were marked by an extended period of national mourning.\n",
            "Near the end of the American Civil War, Lincoln's assassination was part of a larger political conspiracy intended by Booth to revive the Confederate cause by eliminating the three most important officials of the federal government. Conspirators Lewis Powell and David Herold were assigned to kill Secretary of State William H. Seward, and George Atzerodt was tasked with killing Vice President Andrew Johnson.\n",
            "Beyond Lincoln's death, the plot failed: Seward was only wounded, and Johnson's would-be attacker became drunk instead of killing the vice president. After a dramatic initial escape, Booth was killed at the end of a 12-day chase. Powell, Herold, Atzerodt, and Mary Surratt were hanged for their roles in the conspiracy.\n",
